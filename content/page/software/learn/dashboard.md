The Dashboard gives you an entry point to all the application functions and a high level view of some progress indicators.

The "Goals Progress" widget gives a quick idea of how you are doing with all your Goals in one place.

Later on you will be able to personalise what information you put on the Dashboard but for the moment we are repeating the "Known Words and Characters" graph you can also find on [the Stats page](/page/software/learn/stats)
