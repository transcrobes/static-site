# Supported Activities

## Meta-learning
The development focus until now has been on making extensive content consumption tools (web, ebooks, video) available and starting to collect data. [notrobes](/page/software/learn/notrobes) (also see below) already has some basic information on what the system knows about the learner's vocabulary knowledge, including the number of times the word has been seen, definitions looked up, etc. The next phase will concentrate on giving insights to the learner on how they are progressing towards their [goals](/page/software/configure/goals).
