The preferences page allows you to configure the system with any system-wide preferences that aren't directly related to a given tool (e.g, Repetrobes-specific preferences are configured directly in the tool).

Dark mode is now fully supported. There is a [known issue](https://github.com/transcrobes/transcrobes/issues/26) personalising text and gloss colour in [boocrobes](/page/software/learn/boocrobes) that is being worked on.
