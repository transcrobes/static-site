Contents are created by first [importing a supported file format](/page/software/configure/imports), and then telling the system to <b>enrich</b> them. After enriching you can use [boocrobes](/page/software/learn/boocrobes) to read ebooks and [moocrobes](/page/software/learn/moocrobes) to watch videos.

Enriching is a complex process that makes sure all of the content has been properly analysed and that you have all the data you need to get maximum value, including all the glosses, parts of speech and soon grammar. This can take a while (5-20 minutes, depending on a number of factors) so please be patient. The enriching takes place on the server, so you will need to have an internet connect to submit the enrichment request and then to download the enriched files. After that you should be able to consume the content without an internet connection.\*

\* Currently one function - full sentence translation - requires an internet connection. We are working to make this available offline soon.
