In this section of the website you can find resources that will help you connect your learning to other sources. You can obviously bring your own resources to Transcrobes, and for most things like content, you will need to.

You can find getting started information for [beginners](/page/software/learn/getting-started-beginner), or for [advanced Beginners+](/page/software/learn/getting-started-intermediate).

# Recommended courses and resources

Disclaimer: the author/site is *only* affiliated with the City University of Hong Kong and has no connection to the following sites or resources at all (except thinking they are great!).

## External courses for beginners

All of the courses below suggest you use flashcards or even directly tell you to use a specific spaced repetition system - Anki (another free and partially open source system) to help you learn and remember vocabulary. Transcrobes [includes a flashcard/spaced repetition system](/page/software/learn/repetrobes) that is highly optimised for learning language, and learning Mandarin Chinese in particular. Click on the links below to get ready-made resources specifically for each course (and each lesson!) for importing into Transcrobes so you can easily use the Transcrobes flashcard functionality while following along with the courses.

## External information sites

### Hacking Chinese
[Hacking Chinese website](https://www.hackingchinese.com/) has a lot of great free resources. I have no knowledge of their paid courses but if the free resources are anything to go by, they will also be excellent.
