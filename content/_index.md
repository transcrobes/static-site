## What is it?

Transcrobes is an [open source software](https://github.com/transcrobes) and [research project](/page/meaningful-io/intro) that puts the learner at the centre of the language learning process. It builds a representation of the learnerâ€™s lexical (and soon grammatical) knowledge and then uses that information to enrich (gloss) real-world texts in-place as learners consume real-world content, on their preferred devices. It also provides highly optimised tools for learning vocabulary and gives deep understanding into how learning is progressing over time.

## Who is it for?

Transcrobes currently only fully supports learning Chinese for English speakers. If your English is very good, then you should be Ok but otherwise you're better to wait until your preferred language has been implemented. Learning other languages is planned, with English and Russian planned for next.

## Can I try it out?

When you first start learning a language as a young adult (and later), you need quite specialised material, and it is often good to have explicit instruction/teaching on grammar, pronunciation, word-formation, etc. Transcrobes does not yet do this, though we are working on instructions for using it with existing (free) resources from platforms like Coursera. Transcrobes can be used with these courses to greatly improve your learning.

Advanced beginners and above (1000+ words with basic grammar) learners can continue to learn with traditional courses, or could decide that Transcrobes provides everything they need (with extra/free resources they can find online).

If you want to be a part of the active university research project sponsoring the development of this project and try out the software, you can [get information here](/post/experiment/) and [sign up here](https://am.transcrob.es/).

There are also instructions on how to [best make use of the platform](/post/learning/)
