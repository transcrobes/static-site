Roy Harris talks about a "Language Myth" when describing modern (particularly Western) view on "language". But maybe a better way to think about it is as a "Language Conspiracy". Conspiracies are absolutely fascinating phenomena in that something that might very well be seen by one group of a perfectly normal set of activities and states of affairs are seen by others as dastardly actions most foul, devised by a cabal of nefarious masterminds in the making of their ungodly designs.

One absolutely key aspect is *intention* and the associated concept of agency. Now intension and agency are subjects that have been dealt with with ad nauseum over the millenia, in pretty much any culture that has people with enough time for sustained navel contemplation (which is all of them, though not necessarily all the time!). My take is this: there is no such thing as "agency in nature" but we are unable to understand anything without thinking in agentive terms. Humans are social beings, and the basis of our capacity to apprehend and comprehend the world is on the foundation of thinking in terms of agents. Basically, there is no such thing as agency, so we invented it. 

James Paul Gee has a concept he calls the "Transacting Swarm" (Gee, 2020), which I believe is a very fertile one for thinking about agency and particularly how that relates to the idea of language. Essentially, the model/theory/metaphor is that there are multiple layers of interacting elements that cohere at various levels. So quarks cohere to form atoms, atoms to form molecules, ..., cells to form organs, organs to form bodies, bodies to form communities, communities to form nations, etc.

There are a couple of interesting things to note about these:

- what the levels are is not given by nature, it is laid over the system by us. This means that the units of the swarm, at least as we are able to comprehend them, are invented by us as constituent parts. The universe didn't create atoms, the universe just has wobbles in space-time. We are interpreting these things as units, as things. This is due to many factors, including our dominant perceptive capabilities, other physical accidents of evolution, historical accident, etc.

But we can't understand the world like that, we can only think in terms of agents. Some have talked about modern notions of God (in the West at least) as a "God of the gaps". Basically, if we don't yet have a good "scientific" theory for something, God can take care of it, otherwise (S)He isn't required anymore. As we "evolve" and develop "better" scientific theories, God continues to live, but only in the gaps between these theories. If only it were that simple. In many ways science is not at all about "filling in the gaps", all it is doing is putting a new lick of paint on the old delusions. 

Humans understand the world through the prism of their physical senses, which are then made sense of through culture (narrative, Discourse, chronotope, or whatever other term is popular at the moment). The problem is that, because there isn't really anything there to begin with, and obviously that isn't going to motivate us to action much, we need to make something of the wobbles in space-time. So we inject form, mechanism and agency everywhere. Because the form, mechanism and agency aren't really there in the first place, it isn't a massive deal that we invent stuff that puts agency where it isn't there. Vast proportions of the members of our species have at least some belief in agentive beings that we cannot see or hear in the typical sense of the words, many of whom have physical (and spiritual) capabilities that vastly outweigh our own. Many people also believe these agentive beings care about us (what we think, say or do anyway), and can have


So if we agree that even things like atoms aren't "really there", at least in some sense, then what is the harm of talking about "language" and "languages" as if they are "really there"? After all, pretending that atoms are there allows us to do some enormously useful stuff, so why not just pretend for "language(s)". The key to realising the problem is to realise what the "useful stuff" is. Thinking in terms of languages as "things" and of humans as having a special (and unique) "capacity" for language *might* be useful. Like all things in life, it's a little more complicated than that. The problem with modern language scholarship is that is a huge proportion of the so-called "language scientists" act as if thinking about language in these terms (which, we should agree, is a collective hallucination from the outset) is neutral in terms of "externalities". 

So forcing people to learn a "particular language" is a very, very powerful and ideologically driven mechanism for being able to create potentially ever larger Transacting Swarms. This not only allows for creating ever larger Transacting Swarms though, it also very significantly increases the numbers and possible permutations of "sub-Swarms" There is no "language" there though, what we are actually doing is first creating (via grammars and dictionaries, that crystalise a particular set of semiotic habits)
