This blog post announces the official open-sourcing of the (brand new) Transcrobes project. Code is available for all components [on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/transcrobes).

Some ideas were originally [posted to Blogger](https://transcrobes.blogspot.com/) before the code was open-sourced. Future blogposts on the project by the maintainers should happen directly on https://transcrob.es.

Transcrobes proposes a new paradigm for language learning, one that finally puts each individual language learner at the centre of everything. Content-based instruction, extensive reading and other modern approaches have been pushing in this direction for several decades, Transcrobes is an open source project that takes this approach to the logical conclusion.

The system develops and maintains an accurate (digital) representation of the learner's knowledge of the language they are learning, and uses that to provide in-place, context-informed comprehension aids - whatever content they choose to consume and wherever they choose to consume it.
