transcrob.es
============
This is the public documentation and information website for the Transcrobes project, made using hugo (see https://gohugo.io/).

Documentation
=============
The generated content is served by Github Pages, from the https://github.com/transcrobes/transcrobes.github.io repo on the custom domain https://transcrob.es.

Development
===========
The site is mainly informational, and is a pre-generated to static HTML. If you have "permanent" information (so not for the mailing lists) then fork, add/change, and submit a merge request.

The generated content is currently pushed manually rather than from Github actions. This will only change if the current situation becomes an issue (no more over-engineering!).
